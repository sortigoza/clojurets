# clojurets

**Aknowlegements:** This code was based on the https://github.com/gnab/clojurets repo by @gnab.

A simplistic Clojure interpreter written in TypeScript, for running Clojure in the browser or in node.

This is only an experiment in parsing and evaluating a LISP in JavaScript/TypeScript, i.e. it is not intended to be complete in any way.

The current goal of the project is to implement the features listed in the [Clojure Cheat Sheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet) that makes sense running in a browser.

### Getting Started

Only a few, simple steps is required:

    git clone git@github.com:sortigoza/clojurets.git
    cd clojurets
    make

Also, you need node (and npm) installed on your system.

A REPL is provided by running the repl script in the root dir.
